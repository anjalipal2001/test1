API Integration
The Movie Review Web App integrates with the Cohere AI API for sentiment analysis. To use the API, you need to obtain an API key from Cohere AI and replace it in the AddReview.js file:

const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
Right now I am putting my personal API key in this so you dont have to login and generate your own key.
